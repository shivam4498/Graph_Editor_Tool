# Garph-Editor-Tool
A GUI application to represent and visualize the most complex graphs and some of the algorithms like
***Bfs, Dfs and Articulation Points*** in a very meaningful and intuitive way through animation.

- You can add nodes by selecting add nodes option and click in blank areas of the display.
- For connecting the edges select add edge option and click on 2 nodes consecutively.
- This tool is creating a weighted graph, where weight of an edge => distance between 2 nodes.
- Now run different algorithms and find Bridges, Articulation Point.
- Run BFS and DFS to visualize and it will automatically colors the visited nodes.
- Yellow nodes represents Articulation Points and Blue edges represent bridges. 


# Contribution 
- This repositoty is open for open source contribution to help this tool becomes more efficient with more features.
